### Green Bar Patterns
#### Fake it (`Til You Make It)
- If you have broken test:
  - Get to passing tests fast by returning constant
  - Once you have tests passing, implement expression using variables
#### Triangulate
- If you want to drive abstraction with tests:
  - Abstract only when you have two or more examples 
#### Obvious Implementation
- If implementation is obvious:
  - Just implement it
#### One to Many
- If you need to implement operations that work with collections of objects:
  - Implement it without collection first, then implement it with collections
