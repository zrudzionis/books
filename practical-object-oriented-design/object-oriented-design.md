## Object-Oriented Design

### In Praise of Design
Techniques of OO design solve both technical and moral problems while writing
software.
#### The Problem Design Solves
Well designed software is easy to change.
#### Why Change Is Hard
OO design is about managing dependencies. Poorly designed software has 
tightly coupled parts that are hard to change without changing other parts.
#### A Practical Definition of Design
"The code's arrangement is the design. ... The purpose of design is to 
allow you to design later and its primary goal is to reduce the cost 
of change."
### The Tools of Design
Design principles and design patterns.
#### Design Principles
SOLID.
#### Design Patterns
Easy to misuse.
### The Act of Design
Building well designed software despite having design tools is still hard.
#### How Design Fails
Too little design is bad because it makes change slow. Too much design 
is bad because built structures start to get in your way. Finally design
should be tightly coupled with coding since later made design decisions 
are better decisions.
#### When to Design
Big Up Front Design (BUFD) not recommended.
#### Judging Design
Look at metrics with a grain of salt.
### A Brief Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
OO applications consists of objects and messages. Messages are more 
important than objects.
#### Procedural Languages
Data and operations on data are separate.
#### Object-Oriented Languages
Object have data and operations. Objects control access to data 
and operations.
### Summary
If application gets big enough, its biggest problem is dealing with change.
To get most of design theory one must be able to apply it appropriately.
Having knowledge and having skill is two different beasts.
