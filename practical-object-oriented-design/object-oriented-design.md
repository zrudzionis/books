## Object-Oriented Design

### In Praise of Design
#### The Problem Design Solves
Well designed software is easy to change.
#### Why Change Is Hard
OO design is about managing dependencies. Poorly designed software has 
tightly coupled parts that are hard to change without changing other parts.
#### A Practical Definition of Design
### The Tools of Design
Design principles and design patterns.
#### Design Principles
* Use SOLID
#### Design Patterns
### The Act of Design
Building well designed software despite having design tools is still hard.
#### How Design Fails
Too little design is bad because it makes change slow. Too much design 
is bad because built structures start to get in your way. Finally design
should be tightly coupled with coding since later made design decisions 
are better decisions.
#### When to Design
* Big Up Front Design (BUFD) not recommended.
#### Judging Design
* Look at metrics with a grain of salt.
### A Brief Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming
OO applications consists of objects and messages. Messages are more 
important than objects.
#### Procedural Languages
#### Object-Oriented Languages
