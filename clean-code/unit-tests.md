# Unit tests

- Use Test Driven Development
- Three laws of Test Driven Development:
  1. You may not write production code until you have written a failing unit test
  2. You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to fail, and not compiling is failing
  3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to pass the currently failing test
- Keep tests clean
- Keep tests readable
- Use domain-specific testing language
- Tests have different standard than production code (can be less efficient, break Don't Repeat Yourself Principle and so on)
- Recommended one assert per one test 
- Test single concept per single test
- Tests should be F.I.R.S.T:
  - Fast
  - Independent
  - Repeatable
  - Self-Validating
  - Timely
