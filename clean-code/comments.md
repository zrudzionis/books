# Comments

- Comments rot faster than code
- Comments should be used to communicate intent
- Don't use comment when you can use function or a variable
- Good comments:
    - Legal
    - Informative
    - Explanation of intent
    - Clarification
    - Warning of consequences
    - TODO
    - Aplification of importance
    - Javadocs in public APIs
- Bad comments:
    - Mumbling
    - Redundant
    - Misleading
    - Mandated
    - Journal comments
    - Noise comments
    - Position marker comments
    - Closing brace comments
    - Attributions and bylines
    - Commented-out code
    - HTML comments
    - Containing nonlocal information
    - Containing too much information
    - Inobvious connection to code
    - In function headers (short functions don't need them)
    - Javadoc in nonpublic code
