# Systems

- Software systems should separate the startup process, when the application objects are constructed and the 
dependencies are "wired" together, from the runtime logic that takes over after startup
- Direction of dependencies should point away from main
- Abstract Factory Pattern can be used to create instances
- Dependency Injection can be used to avoid instantiation of objects
- Software systems architecture can grow incrementally, if we maintain the proper separation of concerns
- Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) is general-purpose approach to restoring modularity for cross-cutting converns
- Domains of convern should be implemented using plain language constructs
- Postponsed decision is better decision because it relies on most recent knowledge
- Use standards wisely, when they add demonstrable value
- Use Domain Specific Languages (DSL)
