# Classes

- Follow conventional class structure
- Hide implementation details
- Write small classes
- Follow Single Responsability Principle (class should have one reason to change)
- Maintain cohesion (the more variables a method manipulates the more cohesive that method is to its class)
- Split class whenever can't maintain cohesion
- Organize classes for change
- Follow Open-Closed Principle
- Isolate classes from change by using Dependency Inversion Principle
